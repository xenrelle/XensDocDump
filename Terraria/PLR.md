# Terraria .PLR file (Player)

> NOTE: This is only for `.plr` files generated in Terraria PC 1.4.4.9.

Terraria players are stored in `.plr` files located in a "Players" folder in the game's save directory. They contain nearly everything about a player, including inventory, looks, buffs, and certain flags. The only thing that isn't saved in the file are world-specific maps, which are instead stored in a folder based on the player's name.

> • For Windows, the save directory is `%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Players`  
> • For Linux, the save directory is `~/.local/share/Terraria/Players`  

`.plr` files are normally encrypted in AES-128-CBC, the key (and IV) being `68-00-33-00-79-00-5F-00-67-00-55-00-79-00-5A-00` (or `h3y_gUyZ` in little-endian unicode)  
The key is also available in the root of this repository as `key.bin`

Each entry varies in size, due to a dynamic variable being present. However, in practice, the power menu data always seems to be 0x10 (16).<br/><u>For each entry:</u><br/>`Is Power (Boolean)` - Defines if the next few bytes contain power data. If `false`, there are no more powers to parse and the power menu data ends here.<br/>`Power ID (Short)` - Specifies the power ID.<br/>`Value (Dynamic)` - Value of the power. Type is specified via the power ID (shown below).<br/><br/><u>Power IDs:</u><br/>`5` - God Mode. Value is a boolean specifying if God Mode is enabled.<br/>`B (11)` - Increased Range. Value is a boolean specifying if the player has increased range enabled.<br/>`E (14)` - Enemy Spawn Rate slider. Value is a float specifying the rate of which enemies will spawn. In-game, 1.0x is actually `0.5`, and 10.0x is actually `1.0`. This is probably because it's changing the slider position, not the actual spawn rate. |
