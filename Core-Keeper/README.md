# Core Keeper Documentation

(Unfinished) Documentation about Core Keeper.  

I'm not sure if I'll do much with this repository until the full game releases, but I suppose this would be a nice side-project from my Terraria and Minecraft docs.  
I've only played Core Keeper for a few days but it seems genuinely really good, it's like a mix of Minecraft, Terraria, and Stardew Valley.
