# Terraria Documentation

(Unfinished) Documentation about Terraria PC/Mobile/Legacy editions, including file formats and such. Supported up to PC version 1.4.4.9.  

Intended to be a side-project from my Minecraft docs, because I've been dealing with Terraria save files recently. Also Terraria is cool. ~~And better than Minecraft~~.  ðŸ˜Ž
